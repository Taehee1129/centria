            <h4>Why am I learning programming?</h4>
            <p>
                What made me change job has always been 'curiosity'. I am too curious about everything and I always
                want
                to learn new thing.
                After five years of career experience, I realized that there is one common skill I desired to
                improve
                from all different industries.
                It was skills for <b>DATA</b>. I fell in love with data while working on market trend, patent
                specification, sales
                analysis, marketing planning
                and am sure that <em>business is all about data</em>.
                I want to be a specialist in the filed of data engineering who has great understanding and
                experience of
                business as well.
                Switching the company was no longer answer and that's how I end up in BITE program at Haaga-Helia.
            </p>
