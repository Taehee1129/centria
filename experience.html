            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>As a logical problem solver, I have successfully accomplished goals in market research, international
                patent and retail industries. My experience from a wide range of industries demonstrates adaptability as
                well as communication skills as a team.

                Five (5) years of work experience was about planning 'what' to change which naturally lead my interest
                towards the backbone of change, technology. As a result, I wanted to earn technological skill which is
                about 'how' to change.

                Hence, I have started new journey to achieve ICT degree.
                My understanding and experiences of business will make me an exceptional Software Engineer. </p>
